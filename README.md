# UK Used Car Price Prediction
This project focuses on developing a regression model to accurately predict used car prices in the UK using relevant features.

This project follows the PACE strategy to achieve project goals.

Project Goals:
1. Build a regression model capable of predicting used car prices with high accuracy.
2. Identify the key features that significantly influence car prices.
3. Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and techniques.
4. Using the best performing model to predict the prices of cars.

This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of regression model techniques in predicting Uk used car prices accurately. By leveraging advanced algorithms and thorough data analysis, we aim to provide insights into the factors influencing car prices and develop a reliable predictive model.


This dataset shows all adverts on one of the biggest used card website in the UK in Oct 2022.

There are more than 1 million rows of records. Each row represent one vehicle with more than 30 columns each represents a attribute of the advert, such as price, car make, model, variant, transmission, engine size, body type etc..
