# UK Used Car Price Prediction
**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on developing a regression model to accurately predict used car prices in the UK, using relevant features extracted from a large dataset of car advertisements.

**PACE Strategy:**
The project follows the PACE strategy (Plan, Analyse, Construct, Execute) to systematically achieve the following goals:

**Project Goals:**
1. Build a regression model capable of predicting used car prices with high accuracy.
2. Identify the key features that significantly influence car prices.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.
4. Use the best-performing model to predict car prices reliably.

The objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of various regression techniques in predicting UK used car prices. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and thorough data analysis, we aim to provide insights into the factors influencing car prices and develop a robust predictive model.

**Dataset Description:**
The dataset contains over 1 million rows, each representing a vehicle advertised on one of the largest used car websites in the UK, collected in October 2022. The dataset includes more than 30 columns, detailing attributes such as price, car make, model, variant, transmission, engine size, body type, and other relevant features.
