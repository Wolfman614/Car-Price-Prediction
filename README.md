# UK Used Car Price Prediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately predict car prices in UK using relevant features.

Project Goals:
1. Build a machine learning model capable of predicting car prices with high accuracy.
2. Identify the key features that significantly influence car prices.
3. Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and techniques.
4. Using the best performing model to predict the prices of cars.

This project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in predicting car prices accurately. By leveraging advanced algorithms and thorough data analysis, we aim to provide insights into the factors influencing car prices and develop a reliable predictive model.


This dataset shows all adverts on one of the biggest used card website in the UK in Oct 2022.

There are more than 1 million rows of records. Each row represent one vehicle with more than 30 columns each represents a attribute oif the advert, such as price, car make, model, variant, transmission, engine size, body type etc..
